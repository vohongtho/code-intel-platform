## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-27

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### `fix: wipe stale .wal/.shm DB files before write to prevent corruption`
- `analyzeWorkspace --force`: proactively wipes both `graph.db` and `vector.db` stale files (`.wal`, `.shm`, `-wal`, `-shm` variants) upfront before any write
- `analyze` (non-force): also clears `graph.db` stale journal files before writing
- `analyze --embeddings`: also clears `vector.db` stale journal files before writing
- Fixes `Corrupted wal file. Read out invalid WAL record type` error when running `code-intel analyze --force` after an incomplete or interrupted previous run

#### `fix: remove stale LadybugDB files before re-indexing`
- Removes `.code-intel/graph.db` and related files before writing a new index to prevent `not a valid Lbug database` error on repeated runs

---

### ✨ New Features

#### `feat: serve and mcp load from existing index, skip re-analysis`
- `code-intel serve`: if `.code-intel/graph.db` already exists, loads the persisted graph directly and starts the HTTP server immediately — no re-analysis
- `code-intel mcp`: same — loads persisted graph from DB if index exists, skips pipeline
- Add `--force` flag to `code-intel serve` to force a full re-analysis even when an index exists
- `code-intel serve --force` still runs the full pipeline and overwrites the index

#### `feat: write logs to ~/.code-intel/logs/ with daily rotation`
- Logger always writes to console
- In non-production environments: also writes daily-rotating log files to `~/.code-intel/logs/`
  - File pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-code-intel.log`
  - Max size: 20 MB per file
  - Retention: 14 days
  - Directory auto-created on first use; gracefully degrades to console-only if directory is unwritable
- Logger is eagerly initialized on import so the log directory is created even in short-running commands
- Structured `Logger.info()` calls added throughout `analyzeWorkspace`: started, DB persisted, embeddings built, skills generated, context files written, completed

#### `feat: add Logger utility and replace console.* with Logger in core modules`
- Add `src/shared/logger.ts` — lightweight singleton logger with sensitive-data masking and no external dependencies (later upgraded to winston)
- Replace `console.*` calls in:
  - `pipeline/phases/parse-phase.ts` — `console.log` → `Logger.info`
  - `multi-repo/group-sync.ts` — `console.warn/log` → `Logger.warn/info`
  - `http/app.ts` — `console.log/warn` → `Logger.info/warn`
  - `cli/main.ts` — internal `console.warn` → `Logger.warn` (intentional CLI UI `console.log` left unchanged)

#### `feat: add progress bars and spinners to all CLI pipeline phases`
- Add `onPhaseProgress` callback to `PipelineContext` for per-item progress reporting
- Each pipeline phase now emits progress:
  - `scan`: after file walk completes
  - `structure`: per file node created
  - `parse:read`: per parallel file-read batch
  - `parse`: per file symbol extraction
  - `resolve`: per file processed
  - `cluster`: per directory cluster
  - `flow`: per entry point traced
- CLI renders animated `█░` progress bars for all pipeline phases:
  ```
    [parse    ] ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  53% (80/151)
  ```
- Post-pipeline steps (DB persist, skill generation, context file writing) show a braille spinner:
  ```
    ⠹ Persisting graph to DB…
  ```
- Replace flat `Done in Xms` summary with compact `✅` one-liner:
  ```
    ✅  Done in 431ms  —  705 nodes · 1395 edges · 152 files
  ```

#### `feat: multi-repo aware Web UI and HTTP API`
- Web UI: group panel visible when groups are configured
- HTTP API: group-aware endpoints
- `ConnectPage`: improved connection UX

### ♻️ Refactors

#### `refactor: migrate Logger to winston + winston-daily-rotate-file`
- Replace custom console-based logger with [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
- Development: daily-rotating file logs (`./logs/%DATE%-code-intel.log`, 20 MB max, 14-day retention) + console
- Production (`NODE_ENV=production`): console transport only
- Log level controlled via `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default: `info`)
- Sensitive-data masking fully preserved
- Timestamp format: ISO 8601 via `winston.format.timestamp()`
- Add `winston` and `winston-daily-rotate-file` to `core/package.json` dependencies

### 📖 Documentation

#### `docs: update README with progress bars, logging, and architecture changes` (core README)
- Pipeline phases table updated with performance notes (parallel I/O, O(log n) lookup)
- New **CLI Progress Display** section with example output
- New **📋 Logging** section: log directory, file pattern, size/retention, `LOG_LEVEL` env var, production mode, sensitive-data masking
- Architecture tree updated: added `shared/` Logger entry, updated `cli/` description

#### `docs: update root and shared README with progress bars, logging, storage, and architecture`
- Root `README.md`:
  - Features list: updated CLI feature description; added Structured Logging and Performance bullet points
  - Architecture tree: added `shared/` (Logger) and `multi-repo/` entries; updated `cli/` description
  - Pipeline Phases table: updated with parallel I/O and O(log n) notes; added progress bar example
  - New **CLI Progress Display** section
  - New **📋 Logging** section
  - Storage table: added `~/.code-intel/logs/` row
- `code-intel/shared/README.md`:
  - Fixed repository URL (was `your-username`, now `vohongtho`)
  - Expanded all type definitions with full member lists
  - Fixed npm package name (`code-intel-shared`)

### 🔧 Performance (from prior session — included for context)

These improvements were made before commit `d46fee6` and are recorded here for completeness:

- **Parallel file I/O** in parse phase: reads all files in parallel batches of 64 using `Promise.all` + `fs.promises.readFile` instead of sequential sync reads
- **Shared file cache**: parse phase stores all file contents in `context.fileCache`; resolve phase reuses it — eliminates all double disk I/O
- **O(log n) enclosing-function lookup**: replaced O(n²) linear scan with binary search on a sorted per-file function index (`context.fileFunctionIndex`)
- **Expanded scan ignore list**: added `.venv`, `venv`, `.env`, `env`, `__snapshots__`, `.nyc_output`, `storybook-static`
- **File size limit**: skip files larger than 512 KB (generated/minified assets)
- **Ignored file suffixes**: `.d.ts`, `.js.map`, `.d.ts.map`, `.min.js`, `.min.css`
- **O(1) call keyword check**: `CALL_KEYWORDS` changed from `Array.includes()` to `Set.has()`
